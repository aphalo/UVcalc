# UVcalc
R package for UV radiation calculations

This R package is no longer maintained. It has been replaced by packages 'photobiology' and 'photobiologyWavebands' which provide additional waveband definitions. Please, use these newer packages, available through CRAN instead of 'UVcalc' for all new code.
